# Deciding On Home Internet

We are moving into a new house soon. Like 5 days from now, when I'm writing
this. I'd like to have this decided so we can get it installed and ready to go,
so I'm doing some research and compiling it here.

**_Should I move this to Google Docs?_**

## Overall Breakdown
This table should provide an overall breakdown of the services.
Let me know if there is more information that you want in it.
Also let me know if you hear about another provider that I didn't list here so I
can add it.

| Provider Name | Cost Basic | Cost Middle | Cost Adv | Links |
|:-------------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:-----:|
| Comcast | 29.99 /mo NC | 34.99 / 39.99 /mo NC | 44.99 /mo NC | [Comcast](http://www.comcast.com/shop/xfinity-internetplus-west-alt?CMP=KNC-IQ_ID_60897015-VQ2-g-VQ3--VQ6-40778260776-VQ16-c-pkw-%2Bcomcast%20%2Binternet-pmt-b&iq_id=60897015&NUM=2) |
| Century Link | 29.95 /mo NC |    N/A | N/A | [C Link](http://www.centurylink.com/home/internet/?pid=P_C:Q:4127510415&PSTN=Q&mm_campaign=71A718D39708D81462099EA07CE37AF4&keyword=broadband+providers&mkwid=755909541&siclientid=8652&sessguid=eb1f2449-ac87-4d35-9915-42c4047b7142&userguid=eb1f2449-ac87-4d35-9915-42c4047b7142&permguid=eb1f2449-ac87-4d35-9915-42c4047b7142) |

### Unavailable Options
- Verizon FiOS is not in the area, according to their site.
- Same with AT&T U-Verse
- The best local providers are small companies that set themselves up in big
apartment buildings, so a lot of them are unavailable:
  - CondoInternet
  - CascadeLink
  - ReallyFast

## Thoughts

### Comcast
- Our experience this year with Comcast has been less than ideal.
- I, and the reviews from everywhere, agree that their service is poor and their
 cust. support is nonexistent or worse.
- Would be supporting ISP monopoly
- Service is reliably available in every area
- Simple setup
- Middle and upper packages include local TV
- Possibility to upgrade for Red Zone

Comcast isn't really the chillest company in the world. However, the prices are
reasonable, and allow for expansion if we choose to get cable as well. The
numbers that these companies give are pretty misleading, and the low and medium
tier plans only offer internet up to 3 MB/s, which isn't particularly fast,
especially since we are gonna have seven people looking up highly questionable
content before bed every night. Doubling it only costs an extra 5 dollars, and
gets us to 6 MB/s, which is pretty decent. It also provides TV streaming
without having to have cable, which is pretty cool, but it costs 10 bucks. It's
also the highest ceiling I've found in the area. here's also an extreme plan
that costs 3 times as much and gets 12 MB/s, which seems excessive

### Century Link
- Isn't Comcast, and let's us try something new
- Neither have contracts, so no getting stuck with something
- Cheaper per unit speed than Comcast
- Probably equally easy setup
- TV packages are through DirecTV, not too sure what they're all about

Customer satisfaction for Century Link has been much better than Comcast, from
what I've read, even if that's not really an accomplishment. The speed is solid
for thirty dollars at 5 MB/s, but apparently, in the area, it's much much lower.

## Conclusion
ISPs in America are an issue.

But seriously, there aren't any stellar options. CLink is supposed to have
marginally better customer service, but that only means it's bad and not
unbearable. Comcast has better speeds by the research, but who knows? What I
think we should do is just try one for a month, try the other for a month, and
make a decision then. We will inevitably have issues, but at least we will have
made the choice based on something other than what ad agents say.
